# Migration_from_L3VPN_to_EVPN_Type5
## Abstract
Communication Service Providers (CSPs) have successfully implemented advanced deployments of L3VPN (RFC 4364), L2VPNs (RFC 4664), LDP-based pseudowires (RFC 4447), BGP-based VPLS (RFC 4761), and LDP-based VPLS (RFC 4762) to provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity for their customers. If you're overwhelmed by the various standards and RFCs required to establish Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity across WAN backbone networks, you're not aloneâ€”I often feel the same when navigating the extensive standards for Layer 2 connectivity over WANs. To simplify these complexities, EVPN offers a straightforward solution. By utilizing BGP, EVPN streamlines Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services over an MPLS or IP backbone, eliminating the need for multiple protocols. This convergence of L2 and L3 services into a single solution makes configuration easier compared to older standards like LDP-based VPLS or BGP/MPLS L3VPN.

## Scope
In this article, we will examine Junos' implementation of EVPN Type 5, which converts IP prefixes into EVPN routes to extend Layer 3 connectivity across WAN backbone networks. This discussion assumes the reader is familiar with Junos syntax and has a strong understanding of WAN backbone protocols.

## Topology 
![topology](./images/topology.png)

## Methodology
Routes learned from the CE (IP prefixes) via the eBGP group "CE1" will be converted into EVPN Type 5 routes using the routing policy "evpn_export." Subsequently, these routes will be advertised to remote PEs through MP-iBGP (EVPN signaling), with the vrf-export policy "vrf_export" controlling the advertisement of these EVPN Type 5 routes. On the remote PE, the vrf-import policy "vrf_import" will determine which IP-VPN prefixes are accepted from the advertising PE. Additionally, the EVPN import policy "evpn_import" will dictate which IP-VPN prefixes will be installed as EVPN Type 5 routes on the receiving PE. Once the EVPN Type 5 prefixes are installed on the receiving PE, they will be further redistributed to the CE2 via the policy "evpn-to-ce."


## Configuration 
All configurations are taken from the left-side PE.
### VRF Configuration Using EVPN Type 5 Routes
The appended block of configuration (evpn ip-prefix-routes advertise direct-nexthop) enables the conversion of IP prefixes into EVPN Type 5 routes, which are then redistributed as IP-VPN/EVPN Type 5 routes through MP-iBGP EVPN signaling.
