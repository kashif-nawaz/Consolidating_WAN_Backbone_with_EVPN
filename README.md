# Migration_from_L3VPN_to_EVPN_Type5
## Abstract
Communication Service Providers (CSPs) have successfully implemented advanced deployments of L3VPN (RFC 4364), L2VPNs (RFC 4664), LDP-based pseudowires (RFC 4447), BGP-based VPLS (RFC 4761), and LDP-based VPLS (RFC 4762) to provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity for their customers. If you're overwhelmed by the various standards and RFCs required to establish Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity across WAN backbone networks, you're not aloneâ€”I often feel the same when navigating the extensive standards for Layer 2 connectivity over WANs. To simplify these complexities, EVPN offers a straightforward solution. By utilizing BGP, EVPN streamlines Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services over an MPLS or IP backbone, eliminating the need for multiple protocols. This convergence of L2 and L3 services into a single solution makes configuration easier compared to older standards like LDP-based VPLS or BGP/MPLS L3VPN.

## Scope
In this article, we will explore Junos' implementation of EVPN Type 5 routes to extend Layer 3 connectivity across WAN backbone networks. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Junos syntax and has a solid understanding of WAN backbone protocols

## Current Layer-3 VPN Configuration
The current Layer 3 VPN configuration from one of the Junos devices is shown below, and it's relatively straightforward to understand. A VRF named "test" has been created, which includes BGP connectivity to the CE through the BGP group "CE1." The VRF also applies the import and export policies "TEST_IMPORT" and "TEST_EXPORT" for routing control.
```
 test {
    instance-type vrf;
    protocols {
        bgp {
            group CE1 {
                type external;
                peer-as 65100;
                bfd-liveness-detection {
                    minimum-interval 1000;
                    multiplier 3;
                }
                neighbor 100.100.100.0;
            }
        }
    }
    route-distinguisher 172.172.172.1:100;
    vrf-import TEST_IMPORT;
    vrf-export TES_EXPORT;
}
```
### EVPN Type-Configuration 
Appended block of configuration provides funcationaliity to re-dsitrbute IP-VPN routes via MP-iBGP evpn signalling. 
```
vrf_sriov_1001 {
    instance-type vrf;
    protocols {
       
        bgp {
            group CE1 {
                type external;
                export evpn-to-ce;
                peer-as 65100;
                bfd-liveness-detection {
                    minimum-interval 1000;
                    multiplier 3;
                }
                neighbor 100.100.100.0;
            }
        }
        evpn {
            ip-prefix-routes {
                advertise direct-nexthop;
                encapsulation mpls;     
                import net-public-evpn-import;
                export net-public-evpn-export;
            }
        }
    }
    interface et-0/0/0.100;
    route-distinguisher 172.172.172.1:1001;
    vrf-import sriov_import;
    vrf-export sriov_export;
}


```

Routes learned from the CE (IP prefixes) via the eBGP group "CE1" will be converted into EVPN Type 5 routes using the routing policy "net-public-evpn-export." Subsequently, these routes will be advertised to remote PEs through MP-iBGP (EVPN signaling), with the vrf-export policy "sriov_export" controlling the advertisement of these EVPN Type 5 routes. On the remote PE, the vrf-import policy "sriov_import" will determine which IP-VPN prefixes are accepted from the advertising PE. Additionally, the EVPN import policy "net-public-evpn-export" will dictate which IP-VPN prefixes will be installed as EVPN Type 5 routes on the receiving PE. Once the EVPN Type 5 prefixes are installed on the receiving PE, they will be further redistributed to the CE via the policy "evpn-to-ce."

            ip-prefix-routes {

                import net-public-evpn-import;
                export net-public-evpn-export;
            }
        }
